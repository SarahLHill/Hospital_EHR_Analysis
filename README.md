# Healthcare Interoperablity 

**Analyzing Hospital Compliance with EHR Modernization Standards and the Risks to Patient Privacy**

---

## üìò Introduction 

This project takes a closer look at how EHR adoption has transformed healthcare by making patient records more accessible and improving compliance. But digital systems also raise concerns about privacy and security. By analyzing breach reports and hospital interoperability data, this study aims to reveal how modern healthcare must balance innovation with protecting sensitive information.

--- 

## üîç Objective
This analysis investigates the relationship between hospital compliance with EHR modernization efforts and the potential risk to patient privacy. Specifically, it asks whether hospitals that meet interoperability criteria are more or less likely to report data breaches involving protected health information.

### üìä Data Summary

This dataset contains a comprehensive list of hospitals registered with Medicare. It includes facility details such as name, address, phone number, hospital type, ownership, emergency service availability, and overall CMS quality ratings. The data provides a foundational view of hospital characteristics and performance across the U.S.

- **Data Types**: Mix of categorical (hospital type, ownership, state) and numerical (ratings, performance counts, dates)
- **Missing Data**: Several columns contain a high volume of missing values. However, many of these are labeled as "Not Available" and have been consistently standardized during cleaning. Others are considered non-essential for analysis and have been removed to streamline the dataset.
