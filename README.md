This dataset contains a comprehensive list of hospitals registered with Medicare. It includes facility details such as name, address, phone number, hospital type, ownership, emergency service availability, and overall CMS quality ratings. The data provides a foundational view of hospital characteristics and performance across the U.S.

- **Data Types**: Mix of categorical (hospital type, ownership, state) and numerical (ratings, performance counts, dates)
- **Missing Data**: Several columns contain a high volume of missing values. However, many of these are labeled as "Not Available" and have been consistently standardized during cleaning. Others are considered non-essential for analysis and have been removed to streamline the dataset.
